Helm is inflationary. Inflation is a product paid to stakers for minting new tokens through staking. The rate of inflation is fixed to Ï†, the golden ratio. Apart from the first 2 years since the genesis of Helm, which allows users to mint Helm by locking up XEN and earn bonus rewards, the only way to produce more Helm is by staking.
