# Tokenomics

* In order to mint your Helm (**HLM**), you must lock up your XEN Crypto (**XEN**) for 6 years - you will get your **XEN** back when your locking period is over
* on day 1 for each 1,000,000 **XEN** locked, you get to mint 100 **HLM** - or in other words, for each 10,000 **XEN** you lock up, you get 1 **HLM**
* every following day, the rate of **HLM** you can mint goes down by 100 / 730 days (2 years) = 0.136986301369863014 until it is not possible to mint more **HLM**, by locking up your **XEN**, ever again
* inflation rate is fixed to golden ratio 1.618033988749894848
* each mint gets assigned a C Rank, you may mint multiple times
* there is a global C Rank which tracks the number of total mints
* you earn a bonus reward from the global C Rank subtracted by your mint's C Rank, to determine how many mints came after yours, and reward is calculated against the amount you minted and the number of mints that came after you
* your bonus reward may be claimed after 730 days, or 2 years, from the genesis date of the contract
