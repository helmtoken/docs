# Introduction

Cryptocurrencies have been around for some time now. Bitcoin and Ethereum are known to have pioneered the idea of digital currencies and smart contracts. The main idea behind cryptocurrencies is that it has no boundaries, and works as a medium of exchange through a network of computers that does not rely on centralized authority, such as a government or bank.

Cryptocurrencies first adopted and applied principles of self-custody, transparency, trustless, scalable, and zero counterparty risk. However, not all cryptocurrencies today have applied these principles leaving stakeholders vulnerable in some type of way.

XEN Crypto originated with the idea of restoring the first principles of cryptocurrencies at its core. Additionally, XEN Crypto has unique tokenomics which focuses on mass market adoption with the lowest barrier to entry compared to other cryptocurrencies on the market today. XEN Crypto is free, all one has to do is pay the gas fee and they get to mint free XEN tokens.

In traditional finance, a certificate of deposit is a time deposit sold by banks, thrift institutions, and credit unions. CDs typically differ from savings accounts in that the CD has a specific, fixed term before money can be withdrawn without penalty and generally higher interest rate. The system CDs currently run on is a outdated, unreliable, centralized, and needs to be changed.

Helm takes a step further by implementing CDs within the blockchain using smart contracts. Helm replaces inefficient currencies, banks, and payment networks by allowing for secure transactions, built on the foundation of the first principles of cryptocurrencies. In support of the concepts, principles, and vision of XEN Crypto, Helm also gives value to the XEN Crypto community by allowing XEN holders to mint HLM for free.
